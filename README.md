# UPI Fraud Detection System

**AI-Powered Fraud Detection for UPI Transactions using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)**

## 📋 Abstract

The increasing reliance on digital payments in India has led to a significant rise in the use of the Unified Payments Interface (UPI). While this system offers convenience and speed, it has also become a target for fraudulent activities. Traditional methods of detecting fraud often fall short due to the evolving nature of these attacks.

This project presents a machine learning-based approach to identifying fraudulent UPI transactions using **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)**. By transforming transaction data into structured formats suitable for CNN processing, the model learns to identify subtle, non-obvious anomalies that are often missed by conventional systems. The system is capable of adapting to new fraud patterns over time, enabling real-time and accurate fraud detection.

## 🧠 CNN Model Architecture

The fraud detection system uses a custom CNN architecture:

```
Input Layer (8x8x1)
    ↓
Conv2D (32 filters, 3x3) → BatchNorm → ReLU
    ↓
Conv2D (32 filters, 3x3) → BatchNorm → ReLU
